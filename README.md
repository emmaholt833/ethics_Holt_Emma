## My Ethical Principles

_Think of this like your data science ten commandments with respect to ethically using data and data science tools._

Tell the truth, even when it's undesirable. Do not spend time with unnecessary or irrelevant issues. Start with the end in mind, and be willing to stop and let it go. Back up your decisions and conclusions with more logic than emotion.

## Reading Discussion

_Provide a short summary of the primary principle of some readings we completed in class. This summary should be in your style and what you gleaned._

In one of the articles we read, [Data science career advice to my younger self](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-career-advice-to-my-younger-self-4c37fac65184),  I learned that no compnay is perfect, so find one that best fits you priorities. Find a job that maximizes what you love about data science, even if it might not pay top dollar or have the highest title.

Over the course of listening to [The Facebook Files](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11642035385), I learned it is important to speak up when something feels wrong. How long will I staying a job or work on a project that feels off? A great question to ponder, especially while I'm preparing to start my first full-time position.

From [Beware the HiPPO affect](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/?sh=523d645d80f9), . I really enjoyed this take on the modern workplace. I'm interested to see how often I can see this kind of behavior in my future workplaces.
